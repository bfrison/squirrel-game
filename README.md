# squirrel-game
An assignment in which I had to code a rudimentary game where I picked objects up and dropped them.
This repository contains the source files in Java and XML with images in PNG format. It requires Android Studio to compile and to play.
The game consists in a squirrel that can travel on a grid using arrows. The squirrel cannot enter tiles containing trees.
It can pickup acorns and drop them on any grass tile through the inventory.
